# A guide to recipe tags

My recipe template is based off of the entities on [https://schema.org/Recipe](https://schema.org/Recipe) and I've done my best to create a complete _(lolol)_ set of tags that span meal type, ingredients, diets, cooking methods, cuisines, and seasons. It's complicated, and a perpetual work in progress.

### mealType

These will likely become broader categories, at some point.

*   `breakfast` ✓
*   `brunch` ✓
*   `dinner` ✓
*   `dessert` ✓
*   `appetizer` ✓
*   `side-dish` ✓
*   `salad` ✓
*   `sauce` ✓
*   `drink` ✓

### recipeCuisine

*   `asian` ✓
*   `french` ✓
*   `italian` ✓
*   `indian` ✓
*   `russian` ✓
*   `jewish` ✓
*   `mediterranean` ✓
*   `mexican` (TODO)
* 	`moroccan` ✓
*   `latin` (TODO)
*	  `southern` ✓
*	  `modern` (TODO; sous-vide)

### restrictedDiet

*   `vegan`  ✓
*   `vegetarian`  ✓
*   `kosher` ✓
*   `gluten-free`  ✓
*   `dairy-free`  ✓
*   `diabetic-friendly` (TODO)
*   `paleo` ✓

### cookingMethod

The one or two main cooking methods used.

*   `bake`  ✓
*   `braise` (brisket, short ribs)
*   `cure`  ✓
*   `ferment` (kombucha)
*   `freeze`  ✓
*   `fry`  ✓
*   `grill`  ✓
*   `infuse` (vanilla extract)
*   `pickle` (TODO)
*   `poach` (poached pears)
*   `pressure-cook`  ✓
*   `raw` ✓
*   `roast` ✓
*   `saute` ✓
*   `smoke` (TODO)
*   `sous-vide` (TODO)
*   `steam` ✓


### timing

How long this recipe takes, start to finish.

*   `make-ahead`  ✓
*   `quick`_ 30 min or less_  ✓
*   `weeknight`  ✓
*   `weekend`  ✓
*   `diy-project`  ✓

### season

If ingredients or recipe are particularly seasonal

*   `fall` ✓
*   `winter` ✓
*   `spring` ✓
*   `summer`  ✓

### navigation

This is probably the only section that is specific to this website, but these sections are important for me:

*   `basics`  ✓ _for simple preparations or foundational elements to come back to over and over again_
*   `make-ahead`  ✓ _recipes that must be started a day or more ahead of time OR keep well for a number of days_
*   `family`  ✓ _pretty self-explanatory, but recipes that have been passed down from either Lederman, Silverberg, or Brener clans_
*   `diy-project`  ✓ _the kind of recipe that's more of an experiment and that most people would just buy in the store instead, but we try because we're fancy_
*   `remedy` _homeopathic remedies and elixirs for better health and wellness_
*   `gift-idea`  ✓ _things that are great to give away or make for others_
*   `to-do`  ✓ _unvetted recipes that are on my list of things to try_

### recipeType

What kind of dish is this? A `pasta`, `soup`, `cake`? Maybe a `liqueur`?

### recipeIngredient

List the one or two main ingredients in the dish, i.e. `beef`, `chocolate`, `broccoli`. These should reflect their primary food group (dairy, fruit, grains, meat, vegetable, alcohol).
