# A guide to recipe tags

My recipe template is based off of the entities on [https://schema.org/Recipe](https://schema.org/Recipe) and I've done my best to create a complete _(lolol)_ set of tags that span meal type, ingredients, diets, cooking methods, cuisines, and seasons. It's complicated, and a perpetual work in progress.

### mealType

These will likely become broader categories, at some point:  
**[breakfast](/tag/breakfast/), [brunch](/tag/brunch), [dinner](/tag/dinner), [dessert](/tag/dessert),  
[appetizer](/tag/appetizer), [salad](/tag/salad), [side-dish](/tag/side-dish), [sauce](/tag/sauce), [snack](/tag/snack), [drink](/tag/drink)**

### recipeCuisine
**[asian](/tag/asian), [french](/tag/french), [italian](/tag/italian), [indian](/tag/indian), [russian](/tag/russian), [jewish](/tag/jewish), [mediterranean](/tag/mediterranean), [mexican](/tag/mexican), [moroccan](/tag/moroccan), [southern](/tag/southern)**  
_Coming soon: `modern`_

### restrictedDiet

**[vegan](/tag/vegan), [vegetarian](/tag/vegetarian), [kosher](/tag/kosher), [gluten-free](/tag/gluten-free), [dairy-free](/tag/dairy-free), [paleo](/tag/paleo)**  
_Coming soon: `diabetic-friendly`_

### cookingMethod

The one or two main cooking methods used in the recipe:  
**[bake](/tag/bake), [braise](/tag/braise), [cure](/tag/cure), [freeze](/tag/freeze), [fry](/tag/fry), [grill](/tag/grill), [infuse](/tag/infuse), [pickle](/tag/pickle), [poach](/tag/poach), [pressure-cook](/tag/pressure-cook), [raw](/tag/raw), [roast](/tag/roast), [saute](/tag/saute), [steam](/tag/steam)**  
_Coming soon: 'ferment` (for kombucha, ginger beer, kefir), and `smoke`/`sous-vide` (whenever I actually get around to doing them)_


### timing
How long this recipe takes, start to finish (in ascending order):  
**[quick](/tag/quick)** _(for recipes that take 30 min or less)_,  
**[weeknight](/tag/weeknight), [weekend](/tag/weekend), [make-ahead](/tag/make-ahead), [diy-project](/tag/diy-project)**

### season
If ingredients or recipe are particularly seasonal:  
**[fall](/tag/fall), [winter](/tag/winter), [spring](/tag/spring), [summer](/tag/summer)**

### navigation
This is probably the only section that is specific to this website, but these sections are important for me:

**[basics](/tag/basics)**: _for simple preparations or foundational elements to come back to over and over again_  
**[make-ahead](/tag/make-ahead)**: _recipes that must be started a day or more ahead of time OR keep well for a number of days_  
**[family](/tag/family)**: _pretty self-explanatory, but recipes that have been passed down from either Lederman, Silverberg, or Brener clans_  
**[holiday](/tag/holiday)**: _recipes and menus for specific holidays like Passover or Thanksgiving_  
**[diy-project](/tag/diy-project)**: _the kind of recipe that's more of an experiment and that most people would just buy in the store instead, but we try because we're fancy_  
**[remedy](/tag/remedy)**: _homeopathic remedies and elixirs for better health and wellness_  
**[gift-idea](/tag/gift-idea)**: _things that are great to give away or make for others_  
**[to-do](/tag/to-do)**: _unvetted recipes that are on my list of things to try_  

### recipeType ✓

What kind of dish is this? A **[pasta](/tag/pasta), [soup](/tag/soup), [cake](/tag/cake)**? Maybe an **[extract](/tag/extract)**?

### recipeIngredient ✓

List the one or two main ingredients in the dish, i.e. **[beef](/tag/beef), [chocolate](/tag/chocolate), [broccoli](/tag/broccoli)**. These should reflect their primary food group (dairy, fruit, grains, meat, vegetable, alcohol).
