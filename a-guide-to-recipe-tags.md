# A guide to recipe tags

My recipe template is based off of the entities on [https://schema.org/Recipe](https://schema.org/Recipe) and I've done my best to create a complete _(lolol)_ set of tags that span meal type, ingredients, diets, cooking methods, cuisines, and seasons. It's complicated, and a perpetual work in progress.

### mealType

These will likely become broader categories, at some point.

*   `breakfast`
* 	`brunch`
*   `lunch`
*   `dinner`
*   `dessert`
*   `appetizer`
*   `side-dish`
*   `sauce`
*   `drink`

### recipeCuisine

*   `asian`
*   `french`
*   `italian`
*   `russian`
*   `jewish`
*   `mediterranean`
*   `mexican`
* 	`morrocan`
*   `latin`
*	`southern`
*	`modern`

### restrictedDiet

*   `vegan`
*   `vegetarian`
*   `kosher`
*   `gluten-free`
*   `dairy-free`
*   `diabetic`
*   `paleo`

### cookingMethod

The one or two main cooking methods used.

*   `bake`
*   `blanche`
*   `braise`
*   `broil`
*   `cure`
*   `ferment`
*   `freeze`
*   `fry`
*   `grill`
*   `infuse`
*   `pickle`
*   `poach`
*   `pressure-cook`
*   `raw`
*   `roast`
*   `saute`
*   `smoke`
*   `sous-vide`
*   `steam`


### timing

How long this recipe takes, start to finish.

*   `make-ahead`
*   `quick`_Â 30 min or less_
*   `weeknight`
*   `weekend`
*   `diy-project`

### season

If ingredients or recipe are particularly seasonal

*   `fall`
*   `winter`
*   `spring`
*   `summer`

### navigation

This is probably the only section that is specific to this website, but these sections are important for me:

*   `basics` _for simple preparations or foundational elements to come back to over and over again_
*   `make-ahead` _recipes that must be started a day or more ahead of time OR keep well for a number of days_
*   `family` _pretty self-explanatory, but recipes that have been passed down from either Lederman, Silverberg, or Brener clans_
*   `diy-project` _the kind of recipe that's more of an experiment and that most people would just buy in the store instead, but we try because we're fancy_
*   `remedy` _homeopathic remedies and elixirs for better health and wellness_
*   `gift-idea` _things that are great to give away or make for others_
*   `to-do` _unvetted recipes that are on my list of things to try_

### recipeType

What kind of dish is this? A `pasta`, `soup`, `cake`? Maybe a `liqueur`?

### recipeIngredient

List the one or two main ingredients in the dish, i.e. `beef`, `chocolate`, `broccoli`. These should reflect their primary food group (dairy, fruit, grains, meat, vegetable, alcohol).
