# Hello, friend.

## This is a grand experiment.

Somehow, there's no out-of-the-box solution out there on the internet that works the way I want it to (said every [designer](http://www.sharonbrener.com) ever), so I'm biting the bullet and making it myself. In the process, I'm slowly teaching myself Jekyll, Git, and deep diving into CSS/HTML for the first time since college. Seems like the world's a little different out there.

## This site is pretty simple.

Some recipes will be [our family recipes](/tag/family) or [simple basics](/tag/basic), others will be [bigger DIY projects](/tag/diy-project) like making your own bitters or kombucha. Most of these are direct translations from other sources (thank you, sources) and I lay no claims to the content.

Eventually, I hope to add fancy search and commenting functionality so that I can document what I've learned every time I make [something new](/tag/to-do). This is also an exercise in teaching myself to be patient. Is it working yet?

## A canonical recipe format should exist.

Because I work with [a bunch of wonderful nerds](https://data.world), I couldn't help but obsess over the recipe schema. My recipe template is based off of the entities on [https://schema.org/Recipe](https://schema.org/Recipe) and I've done my best to create a complete *(lolol)* set of tags that span meal type, ingredients, diets, cooking methods, cuisines, and seasons. [It's complicated](/a-guide-to-recipe-tags.html), and a perpetual work in progress.

## So, if you've somehow stumbled on this site, [say hi](http://sharonbrener.com/contact/). I hope it makes you hungry.
