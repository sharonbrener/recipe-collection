**Instant Pot chicken stock** Using bones and skin from a rotisserie chicken (because we're still a little bit lazy, but we still deserve nice things); next time I'll wait until more bones accumulate.

**Rotisserie chicken with leeks and broccoli** mainly to pick the meat off the bones we're using for stock (I realize now this is a backwards way to do it...)

**Chicken wonton soup** with the aforementioned homemade chicken broth.

**Leek, spinach, and tomato frittata** Fridge clean-out night.
