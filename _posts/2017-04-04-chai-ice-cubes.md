yield: Makes about 2 cups of strong chai
personalNote: I like to make these in a big batch and drop one or two in either a glass of milk on my way out the door or in a glass of cold brew for an iced dirty chai.

### To prep
In a medium saucepan, combine the water, whole spices, and sugar. Bring to a boil, then cover and remove from the heat. Let steep anywhere from 5-15 minutes, depending on how strong you like the spices to be.

Return to the heat and bring to a boil. Add the tea, remove from the heat, and let steep for another  5-7 minutes.

### To serve hot
Strain out the tea and spices. If you’d like to make a regular batch of chai, add the milk and serve immediately.

### To prep the chai ice cubes
Let the mixture cool a bit, then pour into an ice-cube tray and freeze.

### To serve cold
Add 2-3 ice cubes to a glass of milk (about 1/4 cup of milk per cube). The tea will get stronger the longer it sits and the more the ice cubes melt. Garnish with a dash of cinnamon, and enjoy!
