yield: Makes one 4x8 loaf
authorNote: ''
personalNote: "Make this even better with browned butter and a generous hand with
  the bourbon. If you plan to brown the butter, use unsalted butter and a scant 1/4
  tsp of salt instead of the salted butter.\n\nAlso, super ripe bananas are best.
  Specifically, four of them.\n\nAlso also, this gets even better the next day, but
  it rarely lasts more than two days in our house. "

### To prep

Preheat the oven to 350°F.

With a wooden spoon, mix butter into the mashed bananas in a large mixing bowl. Mix in the sugar, egg, vanilla and bourbon, then the spices.

Sprinkle the baking soda and salt over the mixture and mix in. Add the flour last, mix.

### To bake

Pour mixture into a buttered 4×8 inch loaf pan. Bake for 50 minutes to one hour, or until a tester comes out clean. Cool on a rack. Remove from pan and slice to serve.
