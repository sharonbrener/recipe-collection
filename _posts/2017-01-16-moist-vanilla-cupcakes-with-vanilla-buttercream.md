personalNote: "This has become my go-to cupcake (and buttercream) recipe. The secret
  seems to be the sour cream. \n\nThe author warns against trying to use the same
  batter for a larger cake, though, so proceed with caution."

### To make the cupcakes

Preheat oven to 350°F.

Whisk together flour, sugar, baking soda and baking powder in a large mixing bowl.

Add butter, egg whites, vanilla, sour cream and milk and mix on medium speed just until smooth. Do not over mix.

*Note: You may notice little bits of butter in the batter, but that’s ok. They will melt into the cupcake as they bake.*

Fill cupcake liners a little more than half way.

Bake 18-20 minutes.Allow to cool for 1-2 minutes, then remove to cooling rack to finish cooling.

### To make the buttercream

Combine butter and shortening in a stand mixer and mix until smooth. Add 2 cups of powdered sugar and mix until smooth. Add vanilla extract and 1-2 tbsp of water or cream and mix until smooth.

Add remaining powdered sugar and mix until smooth. Add a little more water or cream until desired consistency is reached.

### To assemble

Pipe buttercream onto the cupcakes, and enjoy!
