yield: Makes 4 really generous or 6 slightly more modest portions. Double in a 9x13-inch
  pan to serve a crowd.
authorNote: 'A tip: If we play our cards right here, this can be made entirely in
  one dish. I used a 4-quart heavy-bottomed braiser but any 3-to-4 quart stovetop-to-oven
  type dish will work.'
personalNote: The original recipe calls for more cheese and baking in the oven for
  20-30 minutes. Usually, the smell is too intoxicating for us to wait that long,
  so we mix in the pasta and dig right in. Sure, it's not crispy on top, but it's
  still ridiculously delicious and we avoid the added cheese. So, healthy?

### To prep

Bring a pot of well-salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook until al dente, about 1 to 2 minutes before perfect doneness. Drain and set aside.

Preheat oven to 400°F.

### To make the sauce

Reheat your empty pasta pot over high heat. Add oil and once it is hot, add mushrooms and cook until they’ve begun to brown and glisten, but have not yet released their liquid.

Reduce heat to medium-high, add onions, salt and pepper and saute together until the liquid the mushrooms give off is evaporated. Add Marsala and cook mixture, stirring, until it has almost or fully evaporated (depending on your preference).

Add butter, stir until melted. Add flour, and stir until all has been dampened and absorbed.

Add stock, a very small splash at a time, stirring the whole time with a spoon. Make sure each splash has been fully mixed into the butter/flour/mushroom mixture, scraping from the bottom of the pan and all around, before adding the next splash. Repeat until all stock has been added. Let mixture simmer together for 2 minutes, stirring frequently; the sauce will thicken. Remove pan from heat.

*Note: This is the point where we usually break down and just eat because it smells so delicious. Sprinkle with parsley and enjoy. But, if you want to go the extra mile for gooey interior pasta and crisp exterior, by all means proceed:*

### To assemble and bake dish:

If you’re cooking in an ovensafe dish, add cooked pasta and stir until combined. (If you’re not cooking in an ovensafe dish, transfer this mixture to a 2-quart baking dish.) Stir in half the parmesan, all of the mozzarella and two tablespoons of the parsley until evenly mixed. Sprinkle the top with remaining parmesan.

Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, until edges of pasta are golden brown and irresistible. Sprinkle with reserved parsley and serve hot. Reheat as needed.
