yield: Yield depends on salmon weight, anywhere from ½ to 2 lb.
authorNote: This is not the lox I grew up with, but this salty, lemony cured salmon
  is subtler and doesn't require much more than a few days of patience and fridge
  space.
personalNote: "For an even lemony-er version, zest 1 ½ lemons and use ¼ rind of a
  preserved lemon.\n\t\nServe with blueberry curd, latkes, and creme fraiche for a
  Hannukah spin, or Nordic style, with rye crostini, pickled fennel bulb, mustard
  seeds and creme fraiche (as pictured by the author)."

### To prep

Place salmon skin side down on a plastic lined sheet pan. Pat dry. Crush juniper berries and peppercorns (a course grind is fine)

Place in a small bowl and add salt, sugar, lemon zest, chopped rosemary (or other herbs). Stir to combine. Add a scant ¼ cup of vodka, just enough to moisten the salt mixture.

Stir and spread evenly over the salmon, pressing it down.

Wrap up tightly in plastic wrap. Place salmon in a baking dish, and set another slightly smaller baking dish over top, pressing down firmly. Pile up a few cans to weigh it down and refrigerate.

### To cure

Leave the salmon in the fridge for between 24-60 hours. The original recipe called for 36 hrs being ideal, but we've found that anywhere between 36 and 60 hours is just fine. The longer you cure it, the saltier it will be.

### To serve

Unwrap the salmon and rinse the cure off under cold, running water. Pat dry and slice diagonally into paper-thin slices.

### To keep and freeze

The cured salmon keeps up to 5-6 days in the fridge and can be frozen for longer. To freeze, wrap tightly with plastic wrap so no air is in contact (which will discolor it) then place in zip lock bag. Sometimes I'll freeze in smaller portions.

Thaw in the fridge for 24-36 hours.

## Spin-offs

I've made this with a combination of fresh and dried rosemary (when we literally salmon-ed our garden out of rosemary) or with dill in place of the rosemary. It's difficult to taste the herbs themselves, so don't worry too much about which ones you use.
