  The one time I made these, they were all the rage. They're much thicker than the basic crepe recipe, but different doesn't mean they're better or worse.

  Serve with blueberry curd.

### To prep

In a medium bowl, whisk the eggs, milk, water, and melted butter until thoroughly combined. In a small bowl, rub together the granulated sugar and lemon zest. In a medium bowl whisk together the flour, salt, poppy seeds, and lemon sugar.

Fold the wet ingredients into the dry and whisk to combine until smooth. Cover with plastic wrap and place the batter in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes.

### To cook

Place a crepe pan or nonstick skillet over medium heat. Brush the pan with a very light coating of butter. Add 2 ounces (1/4 cup) of batter to the center of the pan, and swirl it around until the bottom is coated evenly.

Cook until the edges of the crepe pull away from the pan, 1 to 2 minutes. Flip and cook on the opposite side for another 30 seconds.

Transfer the crepe to a baking sheet and place in a preheated 200 degree F oven to keep warm. Repeat the process with the remaining batter, adding more butter to the skillet when needed, stacking the crepes on the baking sheet.

### To assemble

3\. Spoon blueberry curd over or inside the crepes. Top with fresh blueberries and powdered sugar if you'd like. Enjoy!
