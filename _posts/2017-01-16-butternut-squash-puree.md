yield: Serves 4 as a side, plus leftovers
authorNote: Unlike most purees, which involve cooking a vegetable in liquid, pulverizing
  it in a food processor or blender, and then adding cream and butter—this i recipe
  rebels against such conventions. I also was nte . I wanted a puree that I could
  make in a single paof the squash d to focus on concentrating the flavor  cream.
  I'd like to tell instead of thinning it out with  you that I spent months perfecting
  it; I did not. Lazy, one weekend, I threw a bunch of butternut squash cubes into
  a pan with lots of olive oil_ I covered the pot and simmered the butternut squash
  in this bath of oil until it was good and soft. Then I mashed it right in the pan
  and swirled in a few tablespoons of cream. It worked.
personalNote: "This is a simple side that's easy to get done in the background once
  the squash is cut up. Great alternative to sweet potato for a less-starchy Thanksgiving.\n\nExpect
  to use more cream than the recipe calls for if reheating. "

### To cook

Pile the squash into a large heavy saucepan or Dutch oven. Add the olive oil and season with salt. Cover the pan and place it over medium-high heat. You want the squash to rapidly sauté and steam in the oil, though you should still give it an occasional stir. Continue to cook until the squash is very tender, about 15 minutes. Adjust the heat as needed to make sure the squash doesn't burn. Turn off the heat.

With a potato masher, crush the squash until it's a very smooth mash with no large chunks.

Return the puree to medium heat and pour in the cream so that it just pools on top. Cook until the puree bubbles, then stir the cream in. Taste and adjust the seasoning, adding more salt or cream as needed.

Store in the fridge for up to 5 days.

### Day of (if making ahead)

Reheat the squash in a saucepan over medium heat, stirring often, for 8 to 10 minutes (or in the microwave). Add more cream, salt, and pepper if necessary.
