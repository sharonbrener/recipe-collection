**Skillet lasagna** I made this last week and it was such a hit that even before it was gone, I made another one. Great for lunches.

**[Old world poppy seed roll](http://allrecipes.com/recipe/220763/old-world-poppy-seed-roll/)** One of G's favorite childhood memories, apparently. Came out a little flat but I think that's because I used some internet advice to make our oven into a proofing drawer and maybe should've just let it sit longer. Or add a first proof even though the recipe didn't call for one...

**Pasta con ceci**
Made entirely from pantry staples and comes together in 30 min? A+

**Asian-style tofu with broccoli** Some soy, some mirin, some red pepper flakes, what's not to like?

**Garlicky gnocchi with brussels sprouts and crispy sage** Combining Rena's recipe for garlicky gnocchi with basil with the brown butter and sage version from A New Way to Dinner.

**Roasted cauliflower and...something** Fridge clean-out night.
