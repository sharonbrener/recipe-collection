authorNote: 'The foundation for this 1:1 recommendation is due to two things being
  true: (1) The Instant Pot allows very little water evaporation due to it''s sealing
  ability and (2) rice absorbs its volume in water when cooked long enough.'

### To prep
Measure dry rice, about 1 “cup” minimum recommended, any “cup” size you choose. Set aside.

Measure same amount of water, add to Instant Pot’s inner pot/liner.

Rinse rice until water runs clear, then add wet rice to the measured water in the inner pot without draining thoroughly.

Lock on the lid, and set the steam release valve to “sealing” position.

### To cook

Select your pressure cooking time:

* White rice: 3-8
* Basmati (white) rice: 4-8
* Brown rice (long/short): 22-28
* Wild rice mix: 25-30

### To serve

Let the rice rest for about 10 minutes after cooking is finished before releasing any remaining pressure, and serve.
