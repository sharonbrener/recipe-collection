authorNote: ''
personalNote: "Put the flank steak in the freezer for a few minutes before slicing
  to get thinner, more even slices. \n\nThe flavor is even deeper if you replace the
  white sugar with brown sugar, but either will work. If making in a grill pan, baste
  with marinade to keep beef from sticking and serve with sauce over top."

### To prep

Place the beef in a shallow dish. Combine soy sauce, sugar, green onion, garlic, sesame seeds, sesame oil, and ground black pepper in a small bowl. Pour over beef. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour.

### To grill outside

Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat, and lightly oil the grate.Quickly grill beef on hot grill until slightly charred and cooked through, 1 to 2 minutes per side.

### To grill on a grill pan

Heat a grill pan to high and brush with a neutral oil. Add onions and saute until they begin to soften and remove from pan.

Add beef to the pan and saute until browned and edges are crispy. A few minutes before the beef is done, add back the onions to absorb the sauce.

### To serve

Top with the reserved green onions and more sesame seeds.
