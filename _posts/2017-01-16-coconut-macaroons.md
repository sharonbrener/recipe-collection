yield: Makes about 24 macaroons
authorNote: |-
  Crunchy on the outside, chewy in the middle, a good coconut macaroon is an irresistible thing. It's also a particular favorite for people observing Passover and those who avoid gluten. As long as you have some shredded coconut stashed away in your cupboard and a few eggs that you don't mind cracking, a batch of sweet macaroons can be yours in less than a half an hour.

  Add more coconut for lighter macaroons or whip your whites and sugar into a meringue for an even crunchier version. You can also tuck nuts or chocolate (or both!) into inside your macaroons or fold dried fruit into the batter. And never underestimate the power of a little drizzled chocolate to take your macaroons up yet another notch.

### To prep

Place an oven rack in the bottom third of the oven and preheat to 350°F.

**For deeper coconut flavor and extra-crispy macaroons** spread the coconut on the baking sheet and toast for about 5 minutes, or until just barely starting to show some color. Let cool slightly before using.

Combine the egg whites, sugar, vanilla, and salt in a mixing bowl. Whisk until the whites and sugar are completely combined and the mixture is frothy.

Pour the coconut over the egg white mixture and stir until the coconut is evenly moistened.

Line the baking sheet with a silpat or parchment. With wet hands to prevent sticking, shape the coconut mixture into small balls about 1 ½-inches in diameter (or use a medium cookie scoop). Space them an inch or so apart on the baking sheet.

### To bake

Bake the macaroons until golden, 15-20 minutes.

Let the macaroons cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.

### To keep

Store in an airtight container at room temperature (or in the fridge) for up to a week.

## Spin offs

**For crispier, lighter macaroons**, increase the amount of coconut to 5 cups.

**For meringue-like macaroons**, whisk the egg whites in a standing mixer until they hold soft peaks, then gradually add the sugar until it holds stiff peaks. Whisk in the vanilla and salt, then fold in the shredded coconut by hand.

**For chocolate-covered macaroons**, dip or drizzle the baked macaroons with semi-sweet melted chocolate.

**For Almond Joy macaroons**, wrap the coconut mixture around a whole almond and a piece of chocolate, or just an almond and dip in chocolate.
