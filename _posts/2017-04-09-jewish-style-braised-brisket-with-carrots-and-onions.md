authorNote: Jewish brisket can be tender or moist, but usually not both, since the long cooking required to tenderize the meat also dries it out. This recipe includes steps that help maximize juiciness while still delivering fork-tender meat.
personalNote: "The recipe calls for an aluminum roasting pan, but I used a Dutch oven the way I always have. I also used a smoked salt in addition to regular salt. I made this for the first time for Passover 2017 – we'll see how it turns out!"

### To prep

Set the oven to broil and cover a sheet pan with aluminum foil.

Chop all the onions, carrots, and celery. Honestly, this is half the battle.

Season brisket all over with salt and pepper. Add brisket to sheet pan and brown on both sides, about 6-10 minutes per side.

Meanwhile, add onion, carrot, celery, and garlic to Dutch oven and cook, stirring, until just starting to brown in spots, about 6 min (_though mine didn't brown, I waited until the onions had sweated out most of their moisture, which was more than 6 min_); season with salt and pepper.

Add wine and bring to a simmer while scraping up browned bits from bottom of pan. Stir in ketchup and tomatoes and return brisket to roasting pan, nestling it among vegetables.

### To cook

Add thyme and bay leaves to roasting pan and cover well with foil. Set oven to 280-300°F and cook brisket on middle rack until fork-tender, 3 to 4 hours.

### To rest and slice

Transfer brisket to a work surface and let rest 30 minutes. Skim fat from surface of braising liquid and season with salt and pepper; discard thyme sprigs and bay leaves.

Slice brisket thinly against the grain, then transfer back to braising liquid, making sure to submerge slices well.

### To serve

**If serving the day of**
Cover and let stand for 30 minutes in a warm place. Serve.

### To reheat

**If serving the next day**
Brisket can be made up to 4 days ahead and refrigerated whole or sliced in its braising liquid. Reheat gently before serving.

Preheat oven to 350°F. Remove brisket from fridge, scrape off all solid fat. Slice thinly across the grain.
