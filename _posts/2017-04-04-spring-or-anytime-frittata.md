yield: Serves about three
authorNote: "If using a skillet larger than 10 inches, use 8 eggs instead of 6.  

For a prettier frittata, add all of your veggies in two layers. Add the first half as written, then add the rest after your eggs have partially set in the oven. Continue cooking until eggs are fully set. (This step is entirely not necessary for the actual taste)."
personalNote:
  This has become my go-to frittata template, though really you can put any vegetable you want in there and it'll taste fantastic.

### To prep

Preheat oven to 375°F.

Whisk together eggs and milk with a pinch of salt. (For a fluffier frittata, I like to do this in a blender). Set aside.

Heat an 8 or 10 inch skillet on the stove. Add a bit of olive oil, then add the chopped greens, zucchini, minced garlic, and a few pinches of salt and pepper. Cook for just a minute or so - until the greens wilt and the zucchini starts to soften. Add the tomatoes and more salt and pepper.

Remove about a third of the vegetables from the pan and set aside.

### To cook

Pull out the center rack from the oven and place the pan on the rack. Pour the eggs into the pan, covering the vegetables, add a pinch of paprika, and slide the rack carefully into the oven.

Bake for 20-30 minutes, or until eggs are just set.

Midway through baking, add the remaining vegetables. They should rest just on top of the eggs.

During the last 5ish minutes of cooking time add sage and thyme on top. (If you're using basil, add it just as the frittata comes out of the oven).

Remove from oven, let cool for 15 minutes (or more), then slice and serve. Add more salt & pepper to taste.

## Spin offs

*Really, measurements aren't crucial for frittatas. Pack them full of as much of your vegetable of choice as you can and enjoy! But, here are some of my favorite combinations*

### Broccoli, leek, and cheddar frittata

Chop broccoli into smallish florets and slice leeks thinly. The leeks will need to soften a bit before you can add the broccoli. Add cheese halfway through to let it form just a crispy crust on top.

### Mushroom and asparagus frittata

Add one bunch of trimmed asparagus, a handful of sliced cremini mushrooms, and one thinly sliced shallot to a baking sheet and roast for 15-20 min at 425°F, or until crisp-tender, then follow cooking instrutions.

### [Spinach frittata](http://www.loveandlemons.com/2012/12/03/spinach-frittata/)

Wilt a few handfuls of spinach with the white part of 2-3 stalks of green onions. Add chopped sun-dried tomatoes and a hard cheese if you so desire. Garnish with thinly sliced green tops of green onions.
