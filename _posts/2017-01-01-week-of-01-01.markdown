## Starting off the new year right with a new tradition.

**Beef bulgogi with baby bok choy** I had originally planned to make this with stuck-pot rice, but that seemed like too much work without leftover rice... Will plan better next time.

**Rosy chicken** I've made a similar dish for years, but this oven-baked version from Food52's [**A New Way to Dinner**](https://www.amazon.com/Food52-New-Way-Dinner-Strategies/dp/0399578005) with rosé looked delicious. _Update: unfortunately less delicious than expected. Fairly bland and not crispy enough to make skin-on chicken worthwhile._

**Poached pears in rosé** Can't let the rest of that bottle go to waste from the chicken.

**Ricotta gnocchi for days** Stocking up the freezer. After comparing notes from A New Way to Dinner and the recipe Rena gave me years ago, there's no contest. Family recipe is so much simpler and quicker. Here's to a freezer full of homemade pasta!
