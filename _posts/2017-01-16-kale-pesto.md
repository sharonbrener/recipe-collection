  Despite his hatred for basil and parmesan, I've managed to change Greg's mind about pesto with this kale version.

  Really, this is just a template. You can use spinach, mustard greens, or arugula in place of the kale, walnuts instead of the pine nuts, asiago instead of the parmesan. The world is your pesto-flavored oyster.

### To make the pesto

Combine the kale and nuts in a food chopper or processor and pulse until finely chopped. Add all other ingredients except oil and pulse until coarse paste forms.

Add oil a little at a time until desired consistency is reached. Taste for salt and adjust seasoning if necessary.

### To make ahead

Add a tablespoon or so to each square of an ice cube tray and freeze. Use it to jumpstart pastas and stirfried veggies on busy weeknights when a delicious home-cooked meal seems otherwise unattainable.
