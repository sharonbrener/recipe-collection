### To prep

Supreme the oranges and thinly slice the fennel using a mandolin.

In a small skillet over medium heat, toast the almonds for a few minutes, stirring frequently so they don't burn. Once the almonds are fragrant and starting to turn golden, remove from heat and transfer to a plate.

In a large serving bowl, combine the greens, segmented blood oranges, sliced fennel, diced avocado, goat cheese and warm almonds. If the fennel's feathery fronds (say that five times fast) are in good shape, chop up a handful's worth and toss them into the salad.

### To make the citronette

In a small bowl, whisk together the salad ingredients until emulsified. Whisk in more olive oil if the dressing tastes too tart. The final result should be pleasantly tangy.

### To serve

Add the goat cheese and avocado to the greens.

Once you're ready to serve, drizzle citronette over the salad (you might not need all of it) and toss. Serve immediately.

### To store for later
If you intend to have leftovers, store the salad and dressing separately until you're ready to serve.

If you're really a purist, store the salad ingredients separately and combine at serving time.

## Spin offs

### Vegan and nut-free

Omit the goat cheese and replace the almonds with a type of seed, like pumpkin or sunflower
