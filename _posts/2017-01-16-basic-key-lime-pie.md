### To make the crust

Preheat oven to 350°F.

Stir together graham cracker crumbs, sugar, and butter in a bowl with a fork until combined well, then press mixture evenly onto bottom and up side of a 9-inch (4-cup) glass pie plate.

Bake crust in the middle of oven for 10 minutes and cool in pie plate on a rack. Leave oven on.

### To make the filling

Whisk together condensed milk and yolks in a bowl until combined well. Add juice and whisk until combined well (mixture will thicken slightly).

### To bake and chill

Pour filling into crust and bake on middle rack of oven 15 minutes.

Cool pie completely on rack (filling will set as it cools), then chill, covered, at least 8 hours.

*Note:* Pie (without topping) can be chilled up to 1 day. Topping can be made ahead and chilled separately, but it's better if the cream is whipped fresh.

### To serve

Just before serving, beat cream in a bowl with an electric mixer until it just holds stiff peaks. Serve pie topped with cream.
