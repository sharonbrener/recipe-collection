### For the dough

Mix all common ingredients, and knead into a dough ball. More flour may be needed for the dough to come together.

Cut ball into quarters, and on a floured board roll each piece into long sausage-like shapes. Slice each portion into 1/2 inch pieces.

Place on floured board and into freezer. Once frozen, toss into Ziploc bag for later use.

### To cook the gnocchi

Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Salt water to taste. Place frozen or fresh gnocchi into boiling water for about 4-5 minutes. They are ready when they float to the top.

Scoop them out with a slotted spoon and top with other ingredients.


### To serve

**Sweet cherry gnocchi**
Toss cooked gnocchi with cherries and a teaspoon of sugar. Place dollop of sour cream on top.

**Basil garlicky gnocchi:**
In a skillet melt butter with basil and garlic. Toss cooked gnocchi in butter mixture. Once they are coated, take off the stove and plate the gnocchi. May want to sprinkle with some Parmesan cheese.

**Brown butter sage gnocchi with brussels sprouts and pine nuts**
Melt butter with sage and pine nuts in a wide skillet over medium heat. Cook until the butter begins to brown lightly, 5 to 7 minutes, then fold in brussels sprouts, and turn off the heat. Toss cooked gnocchi into the skillet and spoon mixture into wide, shallow bowls. Top with pine nuts and grated Pecorino. Season with pepper.
