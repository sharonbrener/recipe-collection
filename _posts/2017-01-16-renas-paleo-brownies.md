yield: Makes 24 mini muffins or 12 regular muffins

personalNote: I usually make these with a Mexican chocolate kick – when adding salt,
  include ground ginger, cinnamon, nutmeg, and a touch of cayenne (all to taste).
  An extra splash of Cointreau never hurts.

### To make the brownies

Preheat the oven to 330°F.

Melt chocolate in double boiler, and let cool for 10-15 minutes.

Cream the eggs and coconut oil together. Pour melted chocolate into eggs and oil a little bit at a time to not cook the eggs.

Grind dates to a ball in food processor, add coconut milk (unsweetened) so they are more of a mass, the consistency of thick Greek yogurt.

Mix dates into the chocolate mixture.

Mix in salt, baking soda, and optional flavors if using.

### To bake

Pour mixture into muffin tins – makes 12 muffins.

Bake for 12-15 minutes at 330 or until toothpick comes out dry (almost always takes me 20 min). Top with orange zest.

## Spin offs

**Orange flavor** Add Cointreau and orange zest to taste

**Optional Mexican chocolate flavor** Add ground ginger, cinnamon, nutmeg, and a touch of cayenne to taste

**Hazelnut flavor:** Add Amaretto into mix and top with roughly chopped toasted hazelnuts
