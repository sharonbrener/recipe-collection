yield: Makes one 6x6 baking dish
authorNote: The texture is almost truffle-like, and closer to dark chocolate than to milk chocolate. Even though the yield in this recipe is small, plan to give some away to friends and family. It’s super addictive and you’ll be popping those fudge squares in your mouth before you realize you’ve eating half the batch.
personalNote: If you're making this for someone who's actually vegan (as opposed to why we do, just because they taste delicious), make sure you're using vegan chocolate. It's harder to get than you might think, but we find it at Central Market.

ingredients: |2-

### To prep
Line a small baking dish with parchment paper.

Add the coconut milk to a medium sized saucepan and bring to a simmer, stirring often to avoid scorching. Simmer for 2-3 minutes.

Add the coconut oil to the saucepan and stir until it melts. Add the chocolate chips and stir until they begin melting. Use a whisk to combine the milk and the chips, and continue whisking until the mixture is thick and well-combined.
Remove from heat and stir in the vanilla.

### Chill

Pour into the baking pan and refrigerate until firm (overnight) or freeze for about half an hour. Store in the fridge for up to a week.

### To assemble
When ready to serve, cut into half-inch to one-inch squares and sprinkle with flaky sea salt.

## Spinoffs

**Orange liqueur** Substitute Cointreau for vanilla extract and orange zest or candied orange peel for the flaky sea salt.

**Mexican spiced chocolate**
Add chili powder, cinnamon, and a pinch of star anise when you add the vanilla.
