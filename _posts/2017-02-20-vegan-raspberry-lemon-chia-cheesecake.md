yield: Makes one 8x4 loaf pan (8-10 servings)
authorNote: This recipe requires each layer to be frozen before adding the next so it's best to prep this at least one day before you would like to serve it.
personalNote: This was a huge hit when I made it for non-vegan friends (using real cream cheese, because why not?). Feels indulgent while still being not _too_ bad for you. And the level of effort is so low its hard not to want to make it – I managed to do everything with an immersion blender 💪. The only thing I might try next time would be either 1) putting the raspberry layer in the middle or 2) doing a thinner layer of raspberry and then swirling the rest together with the cheesecake layer. Yum.

### To prep the crust
In a food processor, pulse the walnuts, dates, coconut oil and salt together until crumbly. Line an 8x4” loaf pan with parchment paper allowing 1 inch of overhang on each side. Press the crust into the bottom of the pan.

Freeze for at least 15 minutes or as long as it takes to get the next layer ready.

### To prep the cheesecake layer

Blend all the cheesecake ingredients until smooth.

Freeze until this layer is completely firm, at least 2 hours.

### To prep the raspberry layer

In the blender (no need to wash between layers), combine the raspberries, lemon juice, maple syrup and chia seeds. Blend until smooth. Transfer to a bowl and refrigerate until ready to assemble. When the cheesecake layer is frozen and firm to the touch, pour the raspberry mixture on top and smooth until even. Freeze for 4 hours or overnight.

_Note: At this point, you can be done with Day 1. Adding the raspberry layer to the cheesecake in the morning of Day 1, freezing for two hours, and then cutting was super easy._

### To serve
When ready to serve, remove from the freezer and let thaw for 5 minutes.

Using the sides of the parchment paper, carefully lift the cheesecake out of the pan. Use a sharp chef’s knife to slice it into 8 to 10 slices. Let the individual slices thaw for 15 to 20 minutes, until fully thawed and not icy. (If you’re not serving 8 to 10 people, re-freeze the remaining slices right after slicing.)

_Note: I cut slices a few hours ahead of time and re-froze, then served the bars pretty much straight out of the freezer and it was just fine. I found that the longer it sat out, the cheesecake layer got a little runny._
