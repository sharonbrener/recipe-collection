yield: Makes 1 loaf (about 10 slices)
authorNote: "There's no excuse not to use up those spotty brown bananas hanging around in the kitchen when the method for making banana bread is as straightforward as this. Mash, fold, and bake, and you're well on your way to breakfast or snack-time happiness."
personalNote: "After making this as directed a number of times, I finally (accidentally) figured out a better way. Substitute coconut oil for the melted butter (it doesn't even have to be melted), add a fourth banana if you have it, and use more cake flour than all-purpose. So much lighter and fluffier. Apparently, using oil instead of butter prevents gluten from forming strands keeping it light and cakey rather than bready."

### To prep

Preheat the oven to 325°F.

Grease an 8x4-inch loaf pan with a little butter then line the base and two narrow ends of the pan with one long strip of parchment paper.

Melt the butter in a saucepan. Using a fork, mash the bananas in a large bowl until smooth (though keep a bit chunky if you like bits of banana in tact).

Pour the melted butter into the bananas, then add the eggs and maple syrup. Beat everything together with the fork until the eggs are really well broken up.

Mix the sugar, flour, salt, and baking powder in a bowl then sift onto the banana mixture. _Note: this is optional, I usually just dump it into a single bowl all together and mix thoroughly._

Using a spatula, fold in the flour mixture to make a smooth cake batter. Fold in most of the nuts and chocolate chips, saving a few to sprinkle on the top.

Pour the batter into the pan, then sprinkle the reserved nuts and chocolate across the top.

### To bake

Bake for 1 hr 10 min or until it is golden, has risen well, and a skewer inserted into the middle comes out clean.

The time can vary depending on how ripe your bananas are, as riper bananas will make a looser batter. Let cool in the pan for 15 min or so, then lift out onto a cooling rack.

Serve thickly sliced, with a pat of butter if you like _(though it usually doesn't need anything!)_

### To keep for later

This cake will keep in an airtight container for up to 5 days and can be frozen. To revive less-than-perfect banana bread, toast it lightly or warm gently in the oven or microwave.
