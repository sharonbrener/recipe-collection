personalNote: Crepes are one of my favorite crowd-pleasers. People are always impressed,
  but really it's even easier (and better for making ahead) than a batch of pancakes.

### To prep

In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour and the eggs. Gradually add in the milk and water, stirring to combine. Add the salt and butter; beat until smooth.

*At this point, you can set aside the mix in the fridge for up to a day, or continue straight through.*

### To cook

Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each crepe. Tilt the pan with a circular motion so that the batter coats the surface evenly.

Cook each crepe for about 2 minutes, until the bottom is light brown. Loosen with a spatula, turn and cook the other side. Serve hot.

### To make ahead

Crepes reheat amazingly well and can be made up to days ahead. Just stack on a plate in the fridge and cover with plastic wrap. Reheat crepes individually with filling in a pan, or as a stack in a 225° oven.

## Spin offs

[Smitten Kitchen has some ideas](https://smittenkitchen.com/?s=crepes), but here are a few we like:

**Russian-style crepes** with salmon roe, creme fraiche, and thin slices of cucumber, the way Rena makes them for family gatherings.

**Norwegian-style crepes** with [smoked salmon]({{ site.baseurl }}/2017-01-09-salt-cured-salmon-with-vodka-juniper-rosemary-and-lemon-zest), sour cream, and chives piled on top.

**Classic French fruit crepes** with a simple fruit compote or jammed warmed through on the crepes, or simply with powdered sugar and a slice of lemon for squeezing over.
