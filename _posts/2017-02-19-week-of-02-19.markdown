summary: A dinner party for five, a day off, and all the hot-wing-style chicken drumsticks G can eat. Plus a better version of pecan chocolate chip banana bread, a new salad recipe, and supposed-to-be-vegan raspberry "cheesecake" bars.

## (Dinner) party of five
_Having four of my favorite people in the same place usually kicks me into hyperdrive on the cooking front. But, this time, I'm trying to keep it simple:_

**Appetizer** [This](http://cookieandkate.com/2014/blood-orange-fennel-and-avocado-salad-with-lemon-citronette/) blood orange, fennel, almond and goat cheese salad, because greens and supreming oranges makes everything fancier.

**Main** Garlic butter shrimp with polenta, blistered tomatoes, and saut√©ed kale (or, if one of them chooses to surprise me and want a vegetarian option, sauteed mushrooms over polenta with greens)

**Dessert** Depending on whether we're stuffed to the gills or not, [mini tiramisus](https://smittenkitchen.com/2017/02/small-batch-tiramisu/) or [raspberry cheesecake bars](https://www.loveandlemons.com/raw-raspberry-lemon-chia-cheesecake/) (except made with real cream cheese, because why vegan if you don't have to?). Yes, I did make both ahead of time, thank you.

## What about the rest of the week?

**[Oven-roasted buffalo drumsticks](http://www.thecandidappetite.com/2017/01/25/oven-roasted-buffalo-drumsticks/)** because I love my husband. Also, because our good bud Kenji has a üî• [hot tip](chrome-extension://klbibkeccnjlkjkiokjodocebajanakg/suspended.html#uri=http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2010/02/the-best-buffalo-wings-oven-fried-wings-recipe.html) üî• for making crispy chicken skin in the oven that I want to try.

**Chicken potstickers** pre-made last week üòè, steamed and served with [chili sauce](http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/sichuanese-wontons-in-chilli-oil-sauce-em-hong-you-chao-shou-em-51147600)

**Roasted asparagus with soft-boiled eggs and toast**, a breakfast-for-dinner situation that never goes out of style (also because I finally learned how to --repeatably-- soft-boil an egg and I'm face-palming and making up for lost time)

Probably something baked. Maybe I'll try my hand at those [old world poppyseed rolls](http://allrecipes.com/recipe/220763/old-world-poppy-seed-roll/) again... who knows.
