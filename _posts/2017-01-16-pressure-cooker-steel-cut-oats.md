personalNote: "I make a big pot of steel-cut oats in our Instant Pot just about every
  Sunday night and divide it into portions for the week ahead. That way, G and I can
  both take a healthy breakfast to work every day. Bonus, it comes out to like $0.50
  a day for breakfast. \U0001F443"

### To prep

Add the water, oats, and salt to the pot and stir to combine. Close and lock the lid, making sure it's on `sealing` not venting *(I've made this mistake...you only make it once)*. Set to `Manual` on high pressure for 4 min.

### After cooking
Allow the pressure to release naturally. When the lid is safe to unlock, stir in coconut oil and honey (if using).

At this point, you can also add the toppings, or wait until right before eating, your call. Divide up into individual portions and store in the fridge for up to a week.

### Day of

Reheat oats for 1:30 in a microwave or in a pot on the stove. If on the stove, add water or cream to thin the oats.
