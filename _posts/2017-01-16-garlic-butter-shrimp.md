### To prep

Preheat the oven to 350Â°F.

Rinse the shrimp thoroughly. Place them on a baking sheet and toss with the olive oil, salt, pepper and garlic.

### To cook

Roast for 6-8 minutes, or until the shrimp are pink and just cooked through. Immediately add the butter directly on the hot baking sheet and stir until melted.

Transfer the shrimp and butter sauce to a serving dish and sprinkle with herbs. Serve with lemon wedges and get your hands dirty.
