  to Parmesan-haters, but is way less tasty. Add more salt to taste if you leave out
  the cheese. '

### To prep

Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F and coat a baking sheet with cooking spray.

Slice the zucchini into ¼-inch thick rounds. In a medium bowl, toss the zucchini with the olive oil and set aside.

In a small bowl, combine the Parmesan, bread crumbs, salt, and a few turns of pepper. Dip each zucchini round into the Parmesan mixture, coating it evenly on both sides, pressing the coating on to stick, and place in a single layer on the prepared baking sheet.

### To bake

Bake the zucchini rounds until browned and crisp, 25 to 30 minutes. Remove with spatula. *Serve immediately, before they get cold!*
