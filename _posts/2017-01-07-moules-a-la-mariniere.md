yield: Serves two, but can be adapted to more
authorNote: 'Serve with pomme frites.'
personalNote: The original recipe calls for 6 quarts of mussels, but really 1 lb of
  bivalves per person seems like a good rule. Sub in clams if you're feeling cray.

### To prep

Bring all but the last two ingredients to boil in the kettle. Boil for 2 to 3 minutes to evaporate its alcohol and to reduce its volume slightly.

### To cook

Add the mussels to the kettle. Cover tightly and boil quickly over high heat. Frequently grasp the kettle with both hands, your thumbs clamped to the cover, and toss the mussels in the kettle and an up and down slightly jerky motion so the mussels will change levels and cook evenly. In about 5 minutes, the shells will swing open and the mussels are done.

### To serve

With a big skimmer, dip the mussels into wide soup plates. Allow the cooking liquid to settle for a moment so any sand will sink to the bottom. Then ladle the liquid over the mussels, sprinkle with the parsley and serve immediately.

Serve with pomme frites (also in the source link) or crusty bread to mop up the tasty juices.
