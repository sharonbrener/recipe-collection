authorNote: "If you don't want to use a food processor, remove the lemon peel with a zester or rasp and incorporate all the ingredients into a bowl by hand. You can also use a stand mixer.  

Lemon curd can also be stored in the freezer for several months."
personalNote: "I very loosely followed this recipe, adding in the butter a cube at a time until thickened instead of all at once in the beginning. I also didn't try it in a food processor, combined all the ingredients in the saucepan to not wash an extra bowl, and didn't strain it, because lazy."

### To prep

Zest three lemons using a microplane. Cut all the lemons in half, juice them, and measure out 1/2 cup of juice.

### To combine in a food processor
Combine the sugar and lemon peels in the bowl of a food processor and process until the peels are ground very fine, about 30 seconds. Add the butter, egg yolks, lemon juice and salt to the bowl. Pulse a few times and then process for 15 seconds or so to incorporate everything. The mixture will looked curdled but that's OK at this point.

### To combine without a food processor
Combine sugar, salt, lemon juice, and lemon zest in saucepan. Heat (on medium low) until sugar has dissolved and add the egg yolks and about half the butter, stirring as you go. I then added the rest of the cubed butter as it dissolved to thicken slowly.

### To cook

Pour mixture into a small saucepan and place over very low heat. Stir frequently, using a heat-proof spatula. Do not leave the mixture unattended as it is very easy for it to overcook and curdle.

Cook until the mixture begins to thicken, 12-15 minutes. If you are using a thermometer, cook the curd to 170˚F. You can also test the curd by coating the back of a spoon with the curd and running a finger through it. It should leave a clear, distinct path.

### To strain and store

Pour the curd through a strainer to catch any peel and coagulated egg. If your strainer fits over your storage jar, you can simply strain it right into the jar. Otherwise, strain it into a bowl and then pour it into a jar. Allow to cool to room temperature, then seal the jar and store in your refrigerator. It will keep for a few weeks, if it lasts that long!

## Spin offs

### Any-other-citrus curd

Try experimenting with limes, meyer lemons, grapefruits, and blood oranges. Some of these fruits are sweeter than others, so adjust your sugar up or down accordingly.
