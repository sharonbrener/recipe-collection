### To prep

Preheat the oven to 275°F. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper.

Place the egg whites and sugar in a medium saucepan over medium-low heat. Cook, stirring, until the sugar melts.

Place the warm egg white and sugar mixture in the bowl of a stand mixer and beat on high until the whites are stiff and glossy, about 5-10 minutes.

Add the chocolate chips and mix on medium until incorporated.

Scoop large spoonfuls (or pipe) onto the prepared baking sheets. These cookies won’t spread, but you want to keep an inch between them on the sheet. They will look like fluffy clouds, and will retain this shape during baking.

### To cook

Bake in the oven for about 45 minutes, rotating the sheets halfway through, until they are hard on the outside and soft in the center. The best way to test is to break one in half and make sure it’s cooked through, but still soft.

### To serve and store

Allow to cool completely on the baking sheet before removing them carefully with your hands. Store in an airtight container up to 4 days.

## Spin-offs

_Variations use the same technique up until adding the chocolate chips._

### Mocha
Add **three tablespoons of cocoa powder and one teaspoon of instant espresso powder** and mix on low until incorporated. Pipe as usual. (Inspired by [this recipe](http://www.myrecipes.com/recipe/cocoa-coffee-meringue-kisses))

### Striped and piped
In a small bowl, squirt a little bit of food coloring of choice. To dilute the color, add a bit of water. With a small pastry brush, ‘paint’ colored stripes along pastry bag. Pipe small rounds onto cookie sheets 2 inches apart.

### Using any extract as flavoring
I haven't done this yet, but I'd like to (combined with the striping technique above) – add a **generous ¼ teaspoon of extract** (per [this](http://www.yummly.co/#recipe/Mint-Meringue-Kisses-1927782) example; but to taste) once whites have formed soft peaks. Some ideas for flavoring are:
* Mint (even better if you keep in the chocolate chips)
* Orange with orange blossom water
* Coconut lime
* Elderflower, using [elderflower extract](https://www.amazon.com/Amoretti-Natural-Elderflower-Extract-Ounce/dp/B00KS3LN6O)
* Raspberry with chocolate ganache (from [this recipe](https://bakingamoment.com/raspberry-meringue-sandwiches-with-whipped-dark-chocolate-ganache-filling/))
