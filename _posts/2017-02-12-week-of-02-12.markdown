summary: G was gone all of last week, so I wanted him to come home to something tasty. Plus, Valentine's Day. So, cake. And lasagna.

**Skillet lasagna** This "genius recipe" from Food52 has made lasagna actually something I want to make. We use Italian sausage-seasoned ground turkey and spinach lasagna noodles to healthy it up.

**Afternoon cake** Julia Turshen's cake + her "quick vanilla frosting" (heavy cream + sour cream + vanilla + powdered sugar and voila) for V-Day

**No-churn neopolitan ice cream** I've only ever tried making the coffee (aka tiramisu) ice cream, but venturing out into vanilla and strawberry too.
