summary: A combination of classic Passover dishes and a few new additions for this year's Passover seder (on a Monday ðŸ˜©) where we'll host the parents, brother, and a good friend at our house.

## Passover: Dinner for six
_Two years ago, G and I hosted two good friends and my parents at our tiny downtown apartment. It was a cozy affair full of love and bad dadjokes. Fast-forward to us, married, in our grown-up-person house, and we're attempting to recreate the magic._

### First course

**Matzah ball soup**  
Classic, out of the box, just like Mom used to make #not-ashamed  

**Simple salad of greens and radishes**  
With [creamy mustard dressing](http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/green-salad-with-radishes-and-creamy-mustard-dressing-51262910) and sliced almonds

**[Preserved horseradish](http://www.seriouseats.com/2015/07/how-to-prepare-fresh-horseradish.html)** Why not make our own? It looks ridiculously easy, even if it might require a gas mask. Plus, it'll keep forever in the fridge.

### Main course

**Jewish brisket with carrot and onions**  
Let's be honest, this is the true star of the meal. G's eyes glaze over and he starts to salivate if I even mention making brisket. This year, I'm trying a new [recipe from Serious Eats](http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2016/04/jewish-braised-brisket-recipe.html). We'll see if it makes it into the collection.

**Moroccan cauliflower**  
I wracked my brain over what kind of side would go well with brisket. Carrot tsimmis? Too classic. Greens? Mom's got em covered. A few weeks ago, for a Moroccan-themed Shabbat, I made [this recipe](http://www.foodnetwork.ca/recipe/moroccan-spiced-cauliflower-bites/18689/) in a time crunch, and I love the idea of this slight twist on the classic.

**Green beans**  
Mom's addition to the table, along with a seder plate

### Dessert

**Coconut macaroons**  
Homemade macaroons are (thankfully) nothing like what you'll find in those pop-top cans you see in the Passover aisle of the grocery store. Leveling [these guys](http://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-make-easy-coconut-macaroons-cooking-lessons-from-the-kitchn-186918) up with a drizzle of dark chocolate and (maybe) an almond surprise tucked into the center.

**Chocolate chip meringues**  
I haven't decided if I'm feeling this ambitious, but I like the idea of those little coconut macaroons presented alongside [these pillowy, chocolatey meringues](http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2011/07/chocolate-chip-meringue-cookies-recipe.html), still warm from the oven.

**Chocolate-covered matzah**  
_How can you not?_
