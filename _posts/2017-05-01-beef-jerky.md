yield: Makes quite a bit (road trip sufficient)
authorNote: "This recipe can be made using a dehydrator or a low oven. The recipe yield was hard to gauge.  With 2 pounds of beef, I usually yield around 50 individual pieces of beef jerky.  But that will totally depend on how thick the beef is sliced, and what size of strips you have."
personalNote: "I made this for the first time on our road trip to Santa Fe. It was a welcome savory snack with a peppery kick and no added sweetener and it kept beautifully on our 12 hour drive.

Pro tip: Get the butcher to slice the top round for you very thin. That way, your jerky cooks quicker and you don't have to slice it yourself."

### To prep

Thinly-slice the steak into 1/8-inch thick strips, either with the grain (which will result in a chewier beef jerky) or against the grain (which will be more tender).  I recommend popping the steak in the freezer for 15-30 minutes before slicing so that it is easier to cut. (Or the butchers working behind the meat counters at most grocery stores will also do this for you if you ask.)

Whisk together all the marinade ingredients until combined. Pour the mixture into the ziplock bag with the steak, seal the bag, and toss until the steak is evenly coated.

Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes, or up to 1 day.

### To make using a dehydrator

Lay the strips out in a single layer on the trays of your dehydrator. Then follow the dehydrator's instructions to cook the beef jerky until it is dry and firm, yet still a little bit pliable.  (With my dehydrator, that meant cooking the jerky on medium heat for about 8 hours.  But cooking times will vary based on the thickness of your meat, and the heat/brand of your dehydrator.)  Remove jerky and transfer to a sealed container.  Refrigerate for up to 1 month.

### To make in the oven

Heat oven to 175°F.

Adjust the racks to the upper-middle and lower-middle positions. Line two large baking sheets with aluminum foil, and place wire cooling racks on top of each sheet.  

Lay the strips out in a single layer on the wire racks. Bake until the beef jerky until it is dry and firm, yet still a little bit pliable, about 4 hours, flipping the beef jerky once about halfway through. (Cooking times will vary based on the thickness of your meat.)  

### To store

Remove jerky and transfer to a sealed container.  

Refrigerate for up to 1 month.
