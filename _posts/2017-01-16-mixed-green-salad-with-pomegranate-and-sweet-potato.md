personalNote: "This basic, bright, acidic dressing would be great on just about any
  salad.\n\nThis is a great way to use up leftover sweet potato (which would also
  cut the time it takes to put together by about 75%).\n\nThe pomegranate can be deseeded
  and sweet potatoes can be roasted days ahead and refrigerated, just bring the potatoes
  up to room temperature before serving. "

### To bake the sweet potatoes

In a bowl, mix coconut oil with chopped sweet potato and salt. Pour coated sweet potatoes onto baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Roast sweet potatoes for about 40 minutes. Remove from oven and allow to cool completely.

*This makes a good stopping point if you just want to assemble the rest the day of.*

### To assemble

In a large bowl, toss mixed greens, arugula, sweet potatoes and pomegranate seeds. Set aside while you prepare dressing.

### To make the dressing

Combine garlic, lemon, olive oil, and 3/4 teaspoon salt in a food processor or blender. No need to drizzle in the olive oil, just blend until fully combined.

Toss dressing with salad and serve. Enjoy!
