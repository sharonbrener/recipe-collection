yield: Makes one quart
authorNote: This recipe has 4 ingredients, 1 step, no cooking, and no churning, but
  the ice cream you get will have a creamy, almost buttery smoothness.
personalNote: I use a stand mixer for this recipe to make a simple recipe even easier,
  so really what I'm saying is that there's no good excuse for not always having this
  in our freezer.

### To make the ice cream

Whisk all the ingredients together just until the whisk leaves trails of soft peaks in the bowl, and you have a gorgeous, caffe-latte-colored airy mixture.

Fill two 500-milliliter or two 1-pint airtight containers, and freeze for 6 hours or overnight.

Serve straight from the freezer, with dark chocolate shavings if you want to be fancy.
