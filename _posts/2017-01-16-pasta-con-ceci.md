authorNote: 'It’s astonishing how much comfort you can derive—fast—out of basic ingredients
  you’ve used a thousand times. Here are the keys: First, you need to use all of the
  olive oil—it gives the soup substance and body, carries the other flavors, and makes
  up for the fact that you’re making an otherwise austere soup without a rich stock.
  As Granof says, “It’s what’ll make you think you’re on a balcony in Naples when
  you eat this.” Second, cook the garlic in the oil until it’s actually browned a
  bit, not simply softened. This makes the flavor toasty and nutty, and not bitter,
  despite what nonna might say. You can leave this as soupy or stewy as you like.'
personalNote: 'Haven''t made this yet, but am keeping the pantry stocked with tiny
  pasta and chickpeas for just the right weeknight. '

ingredients: |-
  4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling
  3 cloves garlic, peeled and smashed
  3 tablespoons good tomato paste
  1 teaspoon kosher salt, or more to taste

### To cook

In a large heavy-bottomed pot, heat the olive oil until it shimmers. Add the garlic and cook, stirring until it becomes lightly browned and fragrant.

Stir in the tomato paste and salt and fry for 30 seconds or so. Add the chickpeas, pasta, and boiling water. Stir to scrape up any browned bits on the bottom of the pot, lower the heat, and simmer until the pasta is cooked and most of the liquid has been absorbed, about 15 to 20 minutes. Taste and adjust seasoning.

### To serve

Ladle the pasta into shallow bowls, sprinkle with crushed red pepper flakes, and drizzle a bit of extra-virgin olive oil on top.
