### To prep the cucumbers
Remove the ends and blossoms from the cucumber. Trim the cucumbers into spears, or if you prefer, coins.

### To make the brine
In a small sauce pan, add water, vinegar and salt. Bring to a rolling boil and remove from heat.

### To jar the pickles
In a mason jar, add garlic, dill seed and weed, mustard seed, crushed red pepper, and turmeric. On top of the flavorings, add the cucumber spears. Pour the hot brine over the cucumbers. Seal the jar.

### Let cool and refrigerate
Let the pickles cool before you pop into the fridge. Let the cukes sit for at least 48 hours before you crack into them.

The longer they sit the better. These can be stored in the refrigerator for a couple of weeks.

You can tweak these in any number of ways. You can add a couple cloves of garlic, lightly crushed but still inside their skin. You can use 1/2 to 1 teaspoon dill seeds instead of the fresh dill or 1 tablespoon of pickling spice, if you prefer that flavor. You could add all or a part of one white onion, sliced paper thin (use one less Kirby to compensate for volume). You can add a bay leaf or two.
