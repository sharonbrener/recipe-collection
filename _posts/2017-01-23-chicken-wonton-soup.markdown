yield: Serves 6; makes 8 cups of broth and 50 dumplings
authorNote: 'I include ingredients to “doctor up” store-bought stock with ginger,  garlic
  and scallions but I need to be completely honest here: you can probably skip  it
  too. The wontons have the real flavor here, and a little dash of soy, toasted  sesame
  oil and fistful of scallions go a long way at the end to making this an easy  weeknight
  soup, yes, even with that wonton folding.'
personalNote: |-
  The first time I made this, my wonton wrappers stuck together from being in the freezer too long and were unusable. If that happens again, just make the filling and form into meatballs using a small/medium cookie scoop. Bake meatballs in a 375°F oven for about 20 min and drop into simmering soup for about three minutes. No harm, no foul, although they'll taste a little drier the next day.

  The second time I made these, I made them in square wonton wrappers and it worked out much better. The folding took me longer than Deb specified, but I think the next time will go faster...

### To prep the wonton filling

Combine chicken, soy sauce, salt, sesame oil, ginger, chives and pepper in a bowl with a fork. _If you’d like to test for seasoning, put a tiny dab in a microwave-safe bowl or plate and cook for 10 very splattery seconds. Adjust flavors as desired._

### To form the wontons

Place a few wontons wrappers on your counter. Cover the remaining ones with a piece of plastic wrap. Place 1 heaped teaspoon (from a measuring spoon set) in the center. Use your fingers dipped in water to dampen the edges.

Fold one corner diagonally across to the other, pressing air out as you seal it shut. Then, bring the two corners on the wide side of the triangle down below it and use a dab of water to seal them shut. You’re not trying to pull the corners across the belly, but pointing downward. Lightly sprinkle a big plate with cornstarch and place form wontons on it.

**Note: Once formed, wontons can be refrigerated for up to a day or frozen for a month or longer.**

Repeat with remaining wontons. I found that after I’d made a couple and got the hang of it, I could lay out 6 at a time and get each batch of 6 done in 2 minutes, meaning that this process took me about 20 minutes total.


### To season the broth (optional)

While you’re forming wontons, chop the white and light green parts of your scallions into ½- to 1-inch segments. Cut dark green tops into thin slivers and save for garnish later. Place stock in 3 to 4-quart pot with sliced ginger, the white and light green scallions you’ve just chopped, garlic and soy sauce or salt, as needed, to season.

Simmer them together for 20-30 minutes while you make the wontons, then strain out the ginger, scallions and garlic and pour broth back into pot.

### To cook the wontons

Once your wontons are formed, you can cook them right in the simmering broth (or you can do so in simmering water — the latter is better so that the cornstarch on the wrappers doesn’t make the soup cloudy.)

Boil wontons for 3 minutes to cook them inside; this is really all it takes, but if you’re nervous, cut one in half to make sure.

### To finish the soup

When wontons have 1 min left to cook, add spinach to simmering broth and let cook until softened.

Ladle wontons and soup into bowls. I used about 1 ¼ cups broth and 6 wontons per serving. Drizzle each dish with a little toasted sesame oil, a bit of soy sauce (if desired) and scatter with reserved dark green scallion tops. Dig in.
