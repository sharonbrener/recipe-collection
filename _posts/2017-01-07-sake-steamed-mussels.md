authorNote: Surprise… mussels are so easy. Six ingredients and about 5 minutes later
  we had perfectly steamed mussels in a fancy aromatic sake broth. Make some baby
  bok choy and soba noodles to go along with them (and to soak up more of the broth
  – no sake goes to waste in our house).

### To prep the mussels

Scrub the mussels under cool water, discarding any with broken or cracked shells. Fill a bowl with water and add a tablespoon or two of flour to it. The mussels will eat the flour and spit out their sand after about 10-15 min.

### To cook

Heat a large sauté pan, deep soup pot, or wok over high heat with the sake, ginger, garlic, and shallots.

When the mixture comes to a boil, add the mussels and cover. Cook for 5 minutes, or until the mussels open. Toss in the basil and serve immediately.

### To assemble
For a complete meal, serve with steamed bok choy and soba noodles, garnished with toasted sesame seeds.
