### To prep

Preheat oven to 425°F (220°C).

In a large bowl toss the broccoli florets and minced garlic with olive oil, lemon juice, and red pepper flakes until lightly coated. Sprinkle salt over the broccoli and toss to coat.

Arrange the broccoli florets in a single layer on a baking sheet that has been rubbed with some olive oil or lined with parchment paper or aluminum foil.

*Optional: sprinkle Panko over broccoli for extra crunch.*

### To bake

Roast at 425°F (220°C) for 16-20 minutes until cooked through (check by poking with a fork, should be fork tender) and lightly browned. Flip halfway through if you're feeling fancy, but don't sweat it.

Put the roasted broccoli back in the bowl and toss with lots of freshly ground black pepper and the grated parmesan cheese. Be generous with the black pepper, broccoli loves it! Serve immediately.
