authorNote: "This meat-free wing-style appetizer will entice even the most discerning carnivore with its bright yellow hue and bold flavour profile. Serve as a quick party appetizer or as part of a larger meal as a veggie side dish."
personalNote: 'The first time I made this I doubled the spices and added a few handfuls of Panko breadcrumbs and pine nuts for a Moroccan-themed potluck. I hustled from work to get home by 6, threw this dish in the oven, and was at the dinner with this dish by 7:30.'
