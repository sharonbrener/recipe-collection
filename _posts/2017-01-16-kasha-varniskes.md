### To prep

Cook the pasta to al dente according to the package, strain and set aside.

Saute the onions in olive oil, salt, and pepper until they just start to soften, about 5 minutes.

Then add the mushrooms and saute until they start to soften, about 2 more minutes. Set aside.

While your veggies are sauteing, coat the kasha in an egg. This will help the grain not stick to itself when you are cooking it. Then saute in the same pan until toasted. You'll have to continuously stir to keep the egg from sticking to the pan and browning too quickly. You'll know when it's done when the egg stops sticking and the grains start to separate.

### To cook

Add kasha, mushrooms, onions, and broth to the saute pan.

Bring to a boil, and then lower to a simmer, cover, and cook until all the liquid is absorbed, or about 15 minutes.

Season with more salt and pepper if necessary, mix in pasta, and garnish with parsley and a drizzle of olive oil.
