**Steel-cut oats** It's been a while, but making 2 cups of these guys to flavor later and enjoy as office breakfasts (and not get tempted by donuts).

**Lamb merguez** Making a triple batch of my favorite [lamb merguez](/posts/2017-01-16-lamb-merguez-with-herby-yogurt.md) from Julia Turshen's *Small Victories*. It never disappoints and can be added to pasta, served alongside rice, squash, or broccoli for a surprisingly complete meal.

**Orecchiette with merguez and green onions** According to *A New Way to Dinner*, sausage + something green + something oniony + pasta = good (page 19). Results after the break.

**Roasted asparagus** To serve with the lamb when we're not eating pasta.

**Instant Pot chicken and rice** Trying a new recipe from [Budget Bytes](https://www.budgetbytes.com/2016/06/pressure-cooker-chicken-rice/). Fingers crossed.

**Pan-seared broccoli, maybe with tofu** I've started keeping a big bag of roughly chopped broccoli in the fridge for Emergency Greens. This is the fastest way to put food on the table after a crazy day, for sure.

**Roasted butternut squash** I made the discovery this weekend that G can be placated 100% by throwing a butternut squash, cut in half and seeds scooped out, into a 425Â°F oven for 30-45min. Dinner: solved.
