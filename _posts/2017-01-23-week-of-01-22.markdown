summary: Turning overripe bananas into (new!) banana bread, pureeing some creamy cauliflower-leek soup, and making a bunch of dumplings the right way this time. And, a classic Italian night of eggplant parmesan with creamy polenta and roasted chicken thighs.

**Chocolate chip walnut banana bread** Started the weekend off right with this recipe from [What to Bake and How to Bake It](http://janehornby.com/what-to-bake-and-how-to-bake-it/) (a wonderful Half-Price Books find). Hate to say it, but it gives Deb's Jacked Up Banana Bread a run for it's money...especially day two.

**Cauliflower leek soup** Pureed to a smooth, creamy finish and will serve with roasted cauliflower and maybe rice. Diner en blanc?

**Chicken wonton soup with [homemade chicken stock](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/bobby-flay/rich-chicken-stock-recipe.html)** Doing this right this time with more flavorful stock and non-expired wonton wrappers.

**Eggplant parmesan with creamy polenta** The most comforting, baked not fried. We'll see if I can convert G to being an eggplant lover.

**Gnocchi with brussels sprouts and crispy sage** Didn't get to this last week, so let's actually do this this week...

**Chicken thighs with roasted potatoes and broccoli** Not winnin any awards with this one, but it keeps the natives from getting restless.

**Also** gotta figure out what we're doing with those five beets we roasted last week and didn't eat.
