yield: Makes about ½ cup dressing
authorNote: I discovered the original of this one, unexpectedly, in the pages of Hot and Hot Fish Club, a Southern cookbook published by Perseus in 2009. I can't think of a more perfect way to use it than drizzled thickly over a batch of crisp roast potatoes.

### To prep

If the lemon peel is thin, simply mince it as finely as you can. If it's thick, remove the inner pith and discard, then mince finely.

Combine the preserved lemon with the other ingredients and give them a good whisk (or add to a jar with a lid and shake vigorously). You may not need to salt at all, given the saltiness of the lemon peel. Use at room temperature.
