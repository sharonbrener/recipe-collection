      <h4><strong>Makes one roast chicken, serves 2-4</strong>
          <br />
      From <a href="">The Smitten Kitchen Cookbook</a> by Deb Perelman, p172-4</h4>

  <!-- Author + personal quotes -->

      <blockquote class="authorNote">I learned that taking out the backbone from a chicken-spatchcocking, its delightfully called-meant that we could have roasted chicken with the maximum amount of crispy skin in a minimum of time. And, yes, it is always roasted on a bed of small yellow potatoes. This dish is a win-win for me, and if I don't dawdle, I can get it on the table in only an hour. Did you hear that? You're 1 hour from glossy, crackly-skinned chicken, perfectly complemented by wee potatoes browned in drippings, and a side of green beans. I honestly dont even know why yours still reading this. Get thee to the kitchen!</blockquote>
      <blockquote class="personalNote">I'll admit – I was super freaked out the first time I spatch-cocked a chicken (read: made G cut out the backbone for me), but since then I've gotten used to it. And it's totally true – beautifully roasted chicken in an hour means we'll never buy one of those grocery store rotisserie chickens again.</blockquote>

<!-- Ingredient list -->

    <div class="ingredients">
      <p>One 3-to-3½-pound (1⅓-to-1½-kg) chicken
Table salt
Freshly ground black pepper
1½ pounds (680 grams) tiny yellow potatoes, peeled
2 tablespoons (30 ml) melted butter or olive oil, for potatoes
1 lemon, to finish
1 tablespoon minced fresh thyme
</p>
    </div>

<!-- Method as body content -->

    <div class="method">
      <h3 id="to-prep">To prep</h3>

<p>Preheat your oven to 450 degrees.</p>

<p>Using a pair of sharp kitchen shears, remove the backbone of the chicken and discard it (or freeze and save it for making stock).</p>

<p>Season the cavity generously with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Lay the chicken, breast side up, in a roasting pan (I adore my 12-inch cast-iron skillet for this; it works best with 3-pound birds), and gently pat the breast skin dry with a paper towel.</p>

<p>Generously season the top of the bird with more salt and freshly ground black pepper. Nestle the potatoes around the chicken, and drizzle them lightly with butter or olive oil. Sprinkle the potatoes with salt and pepper.</p>

<h3 id="to-cook">To cook</h3>

<p>Roast the chicken for 30 to 45 minutes, or until a thermometer inserted
into the thigh registers 165 degrees.</p>

<p>Toss the potatoes after about 20 minutes, so that they cook evenly. When the chicken has finished cooking, transfer potatoes to a large serving platter.</p>

<h3 id="to-serve">To serve</h3>

<p>Remove the legs, thighs, wings, and breasts from the spatchcocked chicken, and arrange them with potatoes.</p>

<p>Squeeze juice of entire lemon over dish, then sprinkle with thyme. Serve with simply cooked vegetables. Eat at once.</p>
