      <h3 id="to-prep">To prep</h3>

<p>Preheat oven to 375°F.</p>

<p>Whisk together eggs and milk with a pinch of salt. (For a fluffier frittata, I like to do this in a blender). Set aside.</p>

<p>Heat an 8 or 10 inch skillet on the stove. Add a bit of olive oil, then add the chopped greens, zucchini, minced garlic, and a few pinches of salt and pepper. Cook for just a minute or so - until the greens wilt and the zucchini starts to soften. Add the tomatoes and more salt and pepper.</p>

<p>Remove about a third of the vegetables from the pan and set aside.</p>

<h2 id="to-cook">To cook</h2>

<p>Pull out the center rack from the oven and place the pan on the rack. Pour the eggs into the pan, covering the vegetables, add a pinch of paprika, and slide the rack carefully into the oven.</p>

<p>Bake for 20-30 minutes, or until eggs are just set.</p>

<p>Midway through baking, add the remaining vegetables. They should rest just on top of the eggs.</p>

<p>During the last 5ish minutes of cooking time add sage and thyme on top. (If you’re using basil, add it just as the frittata comes out of the oven).</p>

<p>Remove from oven, let cool for 15 minutes (or more), then slice and serve. Add more salt &amp; pepper to taste.</p>

<h2 id="spin-offs">Spin offs</h2>

<p><em>Really, measurements aren’t crucial for frittatas. Pack them full of as much of your vegetable of choice as you can and enjoy! But, here are some of my favorite combinations</em></p>

<h3 id="broccoli-leek-and-cheddar-frittata">Broccoli, leek, and cheddar frittata</h3>

<p>Chop broccoli into smallish florets and slice leeks thinly. The leeks will need to soften a bit before you can add the broccoli. Add cheese halfway through to let it form just a crispy crust on top.</p>

<h3 id="mushroom-and-asparagus-frittata">Mushroom and asparagus frittata</h3>

<p>Add one bunch of trimmed asparagus, a handful of sliced cremini mushrooms, and one thinly sliced shallot to a baking sheet and roast for 15-20 min at 425°F, or until crisp-tender, then follow cooking instrutions.</p>

<h3 id="spinach-frittata"><a href="http://www.loveandlemons.com/2012/12/03/spinach-frittata/">Spinach frittata</a></h3>

<p>Wilt a few handfuls of spinach with the white part of 2-3 stalks of green onions. Add chopped sun-dried tomatoes and a hard cheese if you so desire. Garnish with thinly sliced green tops of green onions.</p>
