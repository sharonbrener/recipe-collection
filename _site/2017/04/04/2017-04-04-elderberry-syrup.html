      <h3 id="to-prep">To prep</h3>

<p>Pour water into medium saucepan and add elderberries, ginger, cinnamon and cloves (do not add honey!)</p>

<h3 id="to-cook">To cook</h3>

<p>Bring to a boil and then cover and reduce to a simmer for about 45 minutes to an hour until the liquid has reduced by almost half.</p>

<p>At that point, remove from heat and let cool enough to be handled. Mash the berries carefully using a spoon or other flat utensil. Pour through a strainer into a glass jar or bowl.</p>

<p>Discard the elderberries (or compost them!) and let the liquid cool to lukewarm. When it is no longer hot, add 1 cup of honey and stir well.</p>

<h3 id="to-store">To store</h3>

<p>When honey is well mixed into the elderberry mixture, pour the syrup into a quart sized mason jar or 16 ounce glass bottle of some kind.</p>

<p>Store in the fridge and take daily for its immune boosting properties. Some sources recommend taking only during the week and not on the weekends to boost immunity.</p>

<h3 id="to-serve">To serve</h3>
<p>Standard dose is ½ tsp to 1 tsp for kids and ½ Tbsp to 1 Tbsp for adults.</p>

<p>If the flu does strike, take the normal dose every 2-3 hours instead of once a day until symptoms disappear.</p>

<h3 id="how-long-does-elderberry-syrup-last-in-the-fridge">How long does elderberry syrup last in the fridge?</h3>

<p>The short answer is that it really depends. I’ve found that placing the finished syrup in a mason canning jar while it is still warm creates an air-tight seal and allows it to last much longer in the fridge, up to several months. As a general rule, it lasts about two weeks in the fridge and I typically freeze whatever I won’t use during that time. You can also freeze small amounts in an ice-cube tray and defrost small amounts when needed.</p>

<h3 id="can-i-use-powdered-elderberries-in-this-recipe">Can I use powdered elderberries in this recipe?</h3>

<p>Yes, I’ve used powdered elderberries when whole elderberries weren’t available. Just use about 1/2 cup in this recipe instead of 2/3 cup.</p>

<h3 id="what-are-the-benefits-of-black-elderberries">What are the benefits of black elderberries?</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Frontier-Elder-Berries-Whole-Organic/dp/B000UVUHXY/">Black elderberries</a> (sambucus nigra) have been shown to help avoid mild colds and flu and speed recovery in those who already have them. I’ve also found that elderberries seem to offer some relief of discomfort during minor illnesses.</p>

<p>Elderberries naturally contain A, B, and C and stimulate the immune system. Israeli researchers found that the complex sugars in elderberries support the immune system in fighting cold and flu. They developed several formulas based on these complex sugars that have been clinically shown to help ameliorate all kinds of cold/flu. In fact:</p>
