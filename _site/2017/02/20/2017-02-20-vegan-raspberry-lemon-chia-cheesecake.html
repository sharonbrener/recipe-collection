      <h3 id="to-prep-the-crust">To prep the crust</h3>
<p>In a food processor, pulse the walnuts, dates, coconut oil and salt together until crumbly. Line an 8x4” loaf pan with parchment paper allowing 1 inch of overhang on each side. Press the crust into the bottom of the pan.</p>

<p>Freeze for at least 15 minutes or as long as it takes to get the next layer ready.</p>

<h3 id="to-prep-the-cheesecake-layer">To prep the cheesecake layer</h3>

<p>Blend all the cheesecake ingredients until smooth.</p>

<p>Freeze until this layer is completely firm, at least 2 hours.</p>

<h3 id="to-prep-the-raspberry-layer">To prep the raspberry layer</h3>

<p>In the blender (no need to wash between layers), combine the raspberries, lemon juice, maple syrup and chia seeds. Blend until smooth. Transfer to a bowl and refrigerate until ready to assemble. When the cheesecake layer is frozen and firm to the touch, pour the raspberry mixture on top and smooth until even. Freeze for 4 hours or overnight.</p>

<p><em>Note: At this point, you can be done with Day 1. Adding the raspberry layer to the cheesecake in the morning of Day 1, freezing for two hours, and then cutting was super easy.</em></p>

<h3 id="to-serve">To serve</h3>
<p>When ready to serve, remove from the freezer and let thaw for 5 minutes.</p>

<p>Using the sides of the parchment paper, carefully lift the cheesecake out of the pan. Use a sharp chef’s knife to slice it into 8 to 10 slices. Let the individual slices thaw for 15 to 20 minutes, until fully thawed and not icy. (If you’re not serving 8 to 10 people, re-freeze the remaining slices right after slicing.)</p>

I found that the longer it sat out, the cheesecake layer got a little runny.</em></h1>
